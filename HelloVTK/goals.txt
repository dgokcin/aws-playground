- This is a web service in the cloud.
- The users can upload two models
    - The ideal geometry(.obj file)
    - The actual geometry.(.stl file)
* not sure about what the formats should be.

- Once both models are uploaded, two models will be rendered on the screen on top of each other.
The ideal geometry will be rendered with a matte color and the actual will be transparent.

- The rendering magic will be done in the cloud.
